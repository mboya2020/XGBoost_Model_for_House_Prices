## Documentation
For a detailed walkthrough of the analysis, model development, and interpretation, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook: [XGBoost_Model_for_House_Prices.ipynb](link_to_your_notebook).

## Deployment
You can deploy the project by following these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/XGBoost_Model_for_House_Prices.git
cd XGBoost_Model_for_House_Prices
```

2. Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
```

3. Install Required Modules:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook XGBoost_Model_for_House_Prices.ipynb
```

Execute the notebook cells sequentially for a comprehensive analysis.

## Requirements
To successfully run the analysis and Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (specified in the Jupyter Notebook)

## Recommended Modules
The project recommends the following Python modules for smooth execution:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP (for model explainability)

## Installation
Follow these steps for installation:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/XGBoost_Model_for_House_Prices.git
cd XGBoost_Model_for_House_Prices
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
```

3. Install required modules:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
No additional configuration is needed. Ensure the necessary dataset files are in the specified directory.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ
**Q:** I'm encountering issues with data loading.
- Ensure the dataset files are in the correct directory.
- Check file paths and permissions.

**Q:** How do I interpret the model predictions?
- The model predicts a range of house prices, providing variability in the predictions.
